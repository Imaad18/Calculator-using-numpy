# Basic Python Calculator using Numpy for Arrays

This is a basic calculator implemented in Python that supports various mathematical operations using NumPy. The calculator includes operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, matrix multiplication, element-wise operations, and trigonometric functions. It's a command-line tool that interacts with the user through simple text input.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide arrays.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Perform matrix multiplication with two matrices.
- **Element-wise Operations**: Add, multiply, and square elements of an array.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Compute the sine, cosine, and tangent of array values in radians.
- **Error Handling**: Handles division by zero errors and matrix size mismatches.

## Installation

To use this calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the `numpy` library. You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
